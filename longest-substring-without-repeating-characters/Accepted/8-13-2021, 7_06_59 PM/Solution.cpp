        For this problem, I will have the windowstart and end be at 0 because it is the first index
        
        
        The windowend will keep on growing, so I can add the windowend at s[windowend] into the hashmap because 
        we've included that specific character. 
        
        if you find the windoend in the hashtable count is greater than 1:
        
            while the count of the windowend is greater than 1:
                we take the windowstart char 
            
                decrease the frequency of that char  
                 if the frequency is zero:
                    remove the item from the hashtable
                windowstart++ 
        calculate the length of the window string
        
        
        
        I need to calculate the max length of the string constantly
