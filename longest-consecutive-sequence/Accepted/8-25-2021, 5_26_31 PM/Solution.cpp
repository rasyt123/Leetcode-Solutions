        consecutive sum should start with a 1. 
        
        First observations:
        We can use a set or a hashmap here.
        consecutive element all have a difference of 1 with each other 
        
        This question requires multiple passes
        
        We can pass through the array once and add all of the items to a set or a hashmap
        The set will put all of the elements in order already
        
        We can pass through the array a second time and when we do, if the next item
        is equal to 1 plus the current it is consecutive, so we can just update the counter.
        if it isnt we can just reset the counter.
        
        The time complexity will be (O(N) + O(N))
        which is still O(N)
