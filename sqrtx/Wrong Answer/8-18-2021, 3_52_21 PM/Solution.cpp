        Binary Search Problem 
        
        decimal is truncated 
         
         
         
         [1, 2, 3, 4]
         
         Set l to be 1, Set R to be 4;
         
         take the middle of the l and r and test if that if the middle is a 
         square of x 
            if it is just return the middle 
            
         if the middle square is bigger than the target
             we should check the left sorted portion 
         otherwise:
            we check the right sorted portion 
    
    
    
        has to be between 1 and 8
        1 + 8 /2 = 4.5 
        
        4.5^2 20.25
        
        1 + 4.4
        
        We can keep resizing the input and output to be with errors of 0.1 
        and if the difference between mid * mid is less than or equal to 0.5 we should just
        return the truncated version of mid
